# Another React-Redux Boilerplate

This project was built in order to learn Webpack by setting up a React and Redux environment from scratch. It also includes some practices that I consider good to use when developing a new project.

There is a webserver using nodejs and expressjs to provide the static files generated by webpack. In development environement,  In production

## Install and Run

```bash
$ npm install
```

Take a look in `package.json` to see all commands available to run the project.

### Dev Environment

This project uses the webpack dev server with all middlewares defined in 'server/middlewares' folder. To generate the static files and watch them, just do:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Production Environment

First the static files will be generated and placed in 'dist/' folder. UglifyJsPlugin is used in the production build process.

It worths noting that ExtractTextPlugin is used to avoid the css content be inline of html file, so a main.css file is created. The main advantage of this flow is to reduce the main html size and allow browsers to cache css file.

By the end, it is only needed to initialize a nodejs-express server that all static files will be served.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
